### Working with Java data types !important
* Use primitives and wrapper classes, operators, parentheses, type promotion and casting //DONE
* Handle text using String and StringBuilder classes //DONE
* Use local variable type inference, including as lambda parameters //WIP

### Java Object-Oriented Approach !important
* Declare and instantiate Java objects including nested class objects, and explain objects' lifecycles (including creation, dereferencing by reassignment, and garbage collection)
* Define and use fields and methods, including instance, static and overloaded methods
* Initialize objects and their members using instance and static initialiser statements and constructors
* Understand variable scopes, apply encapsulation and make objects immutable
* Create and use subclasses and superclasses, including abstract classes
* Utilize polymorphism and casting to call methods, differentiate object type versus reference type
* Create and use interfaces, identify functional interfaces, and utilize private, static, and default methods
* Create and use enumerations

### Working with Arrays and Collections
* Use generics, including wildcards
* Use a Java array and List, Set, Map and Deque collections, including convenience methods
* Sort collections and arrays using Comparator and Comparable interfaces

### Java Platform Module System
* Declare, use, and expose modules, including the use of services
* Deploy and execute modular applications, including automatic modules


### Java I/O API
* Read and write console and file data using I/O Streams
* Implement serialization and deserialization techniques on Java objects
* Handle file system objects using java.nio.file API


### Database Applications with JDBC
* Connect to and perform database SQL operations, process query results using JDBC API

### Annotations
* Create, apply, and process annotations

### Controlling Program Flow
* Create and use loops, if/else, and switch statements

### Exception Handling
* Handle exceptions using try/catch/finally clauses, try-with-resource, and multi-catch statements
* Create and use custom exceptions

### Working with Streams and Lambda expressions !important
* Implement functional interfaces using lambda expressions, including interfaces from the java.util.function package
* Use Java Streams to filter, transform and process data
* Perform decomposition and reduction, including grouping and partitioning on sequential and parallel streams

### Concurrency
* Create worker threads using Runnable and Callable, and manage concurrency using an ExecutorService and java.util.concurrent API
* Develop thread-safe code, using different locking mechanisms and java.util.concurrent API

### Secure Coding in Java SE Application
* Develop code that mitigates security threats such as denial of service, code injection, input validation and ensure data integrity
* Secure resource access including filesystems, manage policies and execute privileged code

### Localization
* Implement Localization using Locale, resource bundles, and Java APIs to parse and format messages, dates, and numbers
