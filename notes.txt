Bitwise Operators : These operators are used to perform manipulation of individual bits of a number. They can be used with any of the integer types. 
They are used when performing update and query operations of Binary indexed tree
Shift Operators : These operators are used to shift the bits of a number left or right thereby multiplying or dividing the number by two respectively. They can be used when we have to multiply or divide a number by two. General format
	~       Unary bitwise complement
	<<      Signed left shift
	>>      Signed right shift
	>>>     Unsigned right shift
	&       Bitwise AND
	^       Bitwise exclusive OR
	|       Bitwise inclusive OR
