Bitwise Operators : These operators are used to perform manipulation of individual bits of a number. They can be used with any of the integer types. 
They are used when performing update and query operations of Binary indexed tree
Shift Operators : These operators are used to shift the bits of a number left or right thereby multiplying or dividing the number by two respectively. They can be used when we have to multiply or divide a number by two. General format
	~       Unary bitwise complement
	<<      Signed left shift
	>>      Signed right shift
	>>>     Unsigned right shift
	&       Bitwise AND			 (true only all cases are true (1 & 1))
	^       Bitwise exclusive OR (true when one case is true (1^0 || 0^1) and false in the rest (1^1 || 0^0))
	|       Bitwise inclusive OR (true in all cases except when all cases are false (0 | 0))
	
	 


*******Notes from taking Q&As*****************
-Value of switch cases should be a constant, literal value or final variable
-default value for the transient fields = null
-default locale bundle is used if matching key is not found in specified bundle
-An inner class requires an instance of it's outer class to be instantiated
	-new OuterClass().new InnerClass().innerClassMethod();
	-var outer = new OuterClass();
	 or outer.new InnerClass().innerClassMethod();
-An annotation element must be a primitive, String, Class, enum, another annotation, or an array of these types
-static interface methods are not permitted to call default, abstract, or non-static private interface methods.
-A resource must be marked final or be effectively final to be used in a try-with-resources statement
-Generic wildcards cannot occur on the right side of assignments
